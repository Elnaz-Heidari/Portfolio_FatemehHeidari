                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi there! I'm Elnaz Heidari, a passionate and dedicated computer programming enthusiast with a diverse background in language teaching, translation, and software development. With a Master's Degree in English Language Teaching and a Bachelor's Degree in English Language Translation, I bring a unique blend of linguistic expertise and technical skills to the table.</p>
                <p>My journey in the world of programming began with an Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis from George Brown College, Toronto, where I'm currently on track to graduate in April 2024. Throughout my academic journey, I've been recognized for my exceptional academic achievements, including being awarded "excellent" for my Master's thesis and receiving top honors in my Bachelor's course.</p>
                <p>I'm proficient in a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including MS Office, HTML, CSS, SQL, Java, JavaScript, C#, PHP, and Python. I have a keen interest in machine learning concepts, with a focus on artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP). My experience with Agile methodologies and Git version control system has equipped me with the tools to tackle complex projects with ease.</p>
                <p>As an experienced English language teacher and part-time lecturer, I've honed my communication and collaboration skills while teaching General English to students with diverse backgrounds. I've also ventured into the world of software development, where I've worked on various projects using languages such as HTML, CSS, SQL, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I'm deeply passionate about cross-cultural communication, discourse analysis, and language teaching and learning. I've conducted linguistic research at North West University, South Africa, and I've also had the opportunity to learn Swedish language at Umea University, Sweden, where I volunteered to teach English language to newcomers.</p>
                <p>As I continue on my journey in the world of programming, I'm excited to explore new opportunities and contribute to projects that leverage cutting-edge technologies to make a positive impact. I'm driven by a desire to bridge the gap between languages and technology, and I'm committed to lifelong learning and professional growth.</p>
                <p>I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via elnaz.heidarighezeljeh@georgebrown.ca or connect with me on www.linkedin.com/in/fatemeh-heidari-69900284/ to discuss potential projects or just to say hello!</p>
