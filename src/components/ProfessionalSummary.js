            <p>
                I have embarked on a fulfilling academic journey that has allowed me to explore my passion for language teaching, translation, and software development. My educational background encompasses a Master's Degree in English Language Teaching from the University of Kashan, where I excelled in both academic coursework and research, earning recognition for the excellence of my Masterâ€™s thesis.
                <br/><br/>
                My Bachelor's Degree in English Language Translation from Payame Noor University laid a strong foundation for my linguistic skills and understanding, further fueled by my academic achievements as the top student in the English department.
                <br/><br/>
                As I venture into the realm of computer programming and analysis, pursuing an Advanced Diploma from George Brown College, Toronto, I am eager to expand my horizons and merge my linguistic expertise with the technical proficiency required in the field of software development. With an expected graduation in April 2024 and a commendable GPA of 3.60, I am poised to leverage my diverse academic background to tackle complex challenges and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
                <br/><br/>
                My academic journey has not only equipped me with a robust set of skills but has also instilled in me a deep appreciation for cross-disciplinary learning and the power of collaboration. As I look to the future, my next step involves delving into the fascinating field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I aim to apply my linguistic insights and programming skills to explore innovative solutions in AI-driven language technologies.
